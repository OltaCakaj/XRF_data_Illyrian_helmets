This archive contains X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) analytical data collected from Illyrian helmets for archaeometallurgical research.
It includes elemental composition results in .xls format, corresponding XRF spectra images in .png, compiled spectra in .pdf, and a MATLAB script (XRF_spectra.m) used for spectra processing and visualization.
The dataset supports the investigation of alloy composition, technological practices, and material variability among Illyrian helmets and is intended for academic and research use.
